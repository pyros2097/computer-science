# Graph

A graph is defined by these two distinct parts, vertices and edges. Some graphs have many edges as compared to nodes, and are defined as dense graphs, whereas a graph a smaller edge-to-node ratio is called a sparse graph. Similarly, if the edges of a graph have a directional flow, the graph is defined to be directed , while a graph with edges that have no directional flow is undirected.
